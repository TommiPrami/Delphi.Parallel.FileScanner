OmniThreadLibrary 3.07.9 has just been released. It is available via
GIT (https://github.com/gabr42/OmniThreadLibrary/tree/release-3.07.9)
or as a ZIP archive

What is OmniThreadLibrary?
==========================

OmniThreadLibrary is simple to use threading library for Delphi. It's
main "selling" points (besides the price, of course are power,
simplicity, and openess. With just few lines of code, you can set up
multiple threads, send messages between them, process Windows messages
and more. OmniThreadLibrary doesn't limit you in any way - if it is not
powerfull enough for you, you can ignore any part of its "smartness"
and replace it with your own code. If you don't like working with
threads - no problem! You can use high-level primitives like parallel
for, futures and pipelines to introduce parallelism into your
application.

OmniThreadLibrary is an open source project. It lives in the Google
Code and is licensed under the BSD license.

At the moment, OmniThreadLibrary supports Delphi 2007, 2009, 2010, XE,
XE2, XE3, XE4, XE5, XE6, XE7, XE8, 10 Seattle, 10.1 Berlin, 10.2 Tokyo, 
10.3 Rio, 10.4 Sydney, and 11 Alexandria on the Win32 and Win64 platforms. 

There are no plans to support older Delphi compilers. XE2+ support 
is limited to Windows targets. Firemonkey is currently not supported.

    a task in the current thread.
  - [HHasenack] Added Cancel and IsCancelled to IOmniParallelTask.
  - Implemented IOmniParallelJoin.Terminate and IOmniParallelTask.Terminate.
  - Added optional timeout parameter to IOmniThreadPool.Cancel.

- Bug fixes:
  - Fixed warnings in OtlComm.
  - Fixed link to support forum in all units.
